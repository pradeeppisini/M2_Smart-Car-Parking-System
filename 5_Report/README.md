# OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT:
An  Door Opener System is a simple project based on PROXIMITY Sensor and atmega328p, which automatically opens and closes the door by detecting a person or object.

# INTRODUCTION:
The door sensor is an essential component used in-home security system.When someone tries to open the door then these parts will get separated and breaks the circuit, So the control panel will activate to generate an alarm or blink an LED bulb.
# CATEGORY:
sensors use a reed switch & a magnet to decide the status of a door whether it is opened or closed.

# SENSOR MAINTENANCE:
Based on the security system, we can able to modify the type of alert we get once a door opens. We may select a clear alarm for sound whenever a door opens or we can choose a LED blinking light.

# COMPONENTS AND SUPPLIES:
1.atmega328p 

2.LED bulb 

3.Connecting Wires

4.Resistors

5.5V Rail

6.Switch

7.Proximity sensor

# ADVANTAGES:
1. A door sensor lets you know if someone enters your house.
2. You can also set it to emit an alarm that deters someone from entering.

# 4W & H  (WHO,WHAT,WHEN,WHERE,HOW)

# * WHO:
 * A DOOR SENSOR IS THE APPLICATION USED TO DETECT THE PERSONS NEAR THE SENSOR.
# * WHAT:
 * HIGH RELIABILITY.
# * WHEN:
 * IT CAN BE USED ANY TIME MOSTLY.
# * WHERE:
 * PRESENCE OF NEAR BY OBJECTS
# * HOW:
 * EASY TO USE AND ADJUSTED IN A SHORT RANGE.

# * SWOT(STRENGTH,WEAKNESS,OPPORTUNITY,THREATS)

# * STRENGTH:
 * IT IS LESS IN PRICE.
 * HELPS IN SECURITY SYSTEM.
 * TYPE OF ALERT WE GET ONCE THYE DOOR OPENS.
 * WE CAN CHOOSE ALARAM OR LED TO ACTIVATE.
# * WEAKNESS:
 * LIMITED RANGE.
# * OPPORTUNITY:
 * INTERNET OF THINGS(IOT).
 * DOOR SENSOR DEVICES MARKETT UPCOMING TRENDS.
# * THREATS:
 * SENSOR DIS CONNECTION.
 * FAILURE OF THE COMPONENTS.
 * MORE POWER CONSUMPTION.
# OUTPUTS:
# * OFF CONDITION
