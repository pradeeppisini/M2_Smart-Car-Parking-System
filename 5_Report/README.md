# OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT:
The proposed Smart Parking system consists of an on-site deployment of an IOT module that is used to monitor and signalize the state of availability of single parking space.

# INTRODUCTION:
In the present scenario around us we see excess vehicles and the ineffectiveness to manage them in the correct order. As the population increases day by day the rate of utilization also increases and coping up with the numbers becomes a task.

# CATEGORY:
The smart parking system can be divided into five major categories: namely, Parking Guidance and Information System (PGIS), transit based information system, smart payment system, E-parking and automated parking Further discussion on the implementation and characteristic of each of the smart parking system category together with examples of its implementation around the world will also be provided.

# METHODOLOGY:
Shrewd Car Parking System Using Arduino UNO Designing, creating and delivering a main edge stopping innovation is called as Smart stopping. It is a vehicle stopping framework that helps drivers locate an empty spot. Utilizing the Ultrasonic sensors in each stopping space, it identifies the nearness or nonattendance of a vehicle. Brilliant Parking framework is demonstrated as a correct, strong and cost effective approach to guarantee that street clients know precisely where empty car parking spots are.

# ADVANTAGES:
The smart parking system is considered beneficial for the car park operators, car park patrons as well as in environment conservation. For  the  car  park  operators,  the  information  gathered  via  the implementation of the Smart Parking System can be exploited to predict future parking patterns
