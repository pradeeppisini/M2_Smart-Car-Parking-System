# OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT:
An Automatic Door Opener System is a simple project based on PIR Sensor and atmega328p, which automatically opens and closes the door by detecting a person or object.

# INTRODUCTION:
The door sensor is an essential component used in-home security system.When someone tries to open the door then these parts will get separated and breaks the circuit, So the control panel will activate to generate an alarm or blink an LED bulb.
# CATEGORY:
sensors use a reed switch & a magnet to decide the status of a door whether it is opened or closed.

# SENSOR MAINTENANCE:
Based on the security system, we can able to modify the type of alert we get once a door opens. We may select a clear alarm for sound whenever a door opens or we can choose a LED blinking light.

# COMPONENTS AND SUPPLIES:
1.atmega328p 

2.Ultrasonic Sensor - HC-SR04 (Generic)

3.LED bulb or Buzzer

4.Connecting Wires

5.Resistors

6.5V Rail

7.Switch

# ADVANTAGES:
1. A door sensor lets you know if someone enters your house.
2. You can also set it to emit an alarm that deters someone from entering.
